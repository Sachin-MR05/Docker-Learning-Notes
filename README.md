# Docker Learning Notes 📦🐳

Welcome to the **Docker Learning Notes** repository — a structured set of notes crafted during my Docker learning journey. This repo captures core Docker concepts, commands, workflows, and their relevance to modern software and AI/ML systems. 

These notes are created with the purpose of **helping myself and others** understand Docker fundamentals quickly and clearly. If you're learning Docker — especially in the context of ML/AI development, team projects, and cloud deployments — this repo is for you.

## 📌 Why This Repository Exists

When I started learning Docker, I found a lot of content online but lacked a **single structured reference** that:

- explains concepts in simple language,
- connects ideas with practical usage,
- and shows *why Docker matters especially for AI/ML workflows*.

As part of my **open-source learning journey**, I converted my **handwritten notes** into organized markdown files so that anyone can access, use, and contribute.

This repository also welcomes **pull requests** from others who want to add more notes, examples, diagrams, corrections, or explanations on important Docker topics.

## 🧠 What Docker Topics Are Covered

The repository is organized into multiple markdown files covering key Docker concepts:

| File | Topic | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `00-introduction.md` | Introduction | Purpose & overview of this repo |
| `01-why-docker.md` | Why Docker | Motivation, problems Docker solves |
| `02-images-vs-containers.md` | Images vs Containers | Difference & analogy |
| `03-docker-architecture.md` | Docker Architecture | Components like Engine, Daemon, CLI |
| `04-dockerfile.md` | Dockerfile | How to write a Dockerfile |
| `05-docker-commands.md` | Docker Commands | Essential commands explained |
| `06-docker-compose.md` | Docker Compose | Multi-service setup for dev |
| `07-dockerhub-and-registry.md` | Registries | Docker Hub & other registries |
| `08-dev-vs-prod-workflow.md` | Dev vs Prod | Git + CI/CD + Docker workflow |
| `09-docker-for-ml-ai.md` | Docker for ML/AI | How Docker supports ML projects |

There are also folders:



These contain **supporting materials** like scanned handwritten pages and visual diagrams for easier reference.

## 🔗 Reference Videos Used

The content in these notes is influenced by the following YouTube tutorials (linked with timestamps and topics served as inspiration):

| Video | Key Coverage |
|-------|--------------|
| https://youtu.be/GToyQTGDOS4?si=4I1Z7EV_QR-saqj1 | Docker basics, why use Docker, images vs containers, basic Docker commands |
| https://youtu.be/exmSJpJvIPs?si=Lnx-eLHv6mJfHMV- | Dockerfile creation, how images are built, Docker Compose intro |

If you use this repo for learning, you can refer back to those videos for deeper examples and demos.

## 🎯 How These Notes Help AI / ML Developers

In machine learning and AI development, Docker becomes essential when:

- your environment must be **reproducible** (no “works on my machine” problem),
- you want to **dockerize ML model servers**, scheduled jobs, or batch pipelines,
- you are sharing your project with teammates across OSes and setups,
- you prepare your projects for **cloud deployment** (AWS/Azure/GCP),
- you integrate container workflows into CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines),
- you build APIs for model inference (Flask/FastAPI) and want consistent runtime.

This repo not only teaches Docker basics but also frames them in an **applied context for ML/AI workflows** — bridging the gap between research/code and deployable AI systems.

## 🤝 Contribution Guide

I’m eager to collaborate! If you want to improve:

- existing explanations,
- add new topics (e.g., multi‐stage builds, Docker security, volume best practices),
- fix typos,
- add diagrams or examples,

…please make a **Pull Request**! Even small contributions help make this repo better for everyone.
