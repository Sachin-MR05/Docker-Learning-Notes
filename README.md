## 🎯 How These Notes Help AI / ML Developers

In machine learning and AI development, Docker becomes essential when:

- your environment must be **reproducible** (no “works on my machine” problem),
- you want to **dockerize ML model servers**, scheduled jobs, or batch pipelines,
- you are sharing your project with teammates across OSes and setups,
- you prepare your projects for **cloud deployment** (AWS/Azure/GCP),
- you integrate container workflows into CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines),
- you build APIs for model inference (Flask/FastAPI) and want consistent runtime.

This repo not only teaches Docker basics but also frames them in an **applied context for ML/AI workflows** — bridging the gap between research/code and deployable AI systems.
